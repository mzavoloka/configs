# Configs Aggregator
Plenty of information and configuration files that will help you to configure your operating system and programs.

I always forget what I've done before to set up some program in a way I like.
I also often forget where my most recent configs are stored.
And from time to time I have to configure freshly installed OS.
That's why I decided to make an aggregator of useful information on how to configure things.
You can find here how to install essential programs that (probably) you always install on any PC you use.
